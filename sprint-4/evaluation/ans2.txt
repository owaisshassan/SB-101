ACID:

In SQL, when we perform Transactions, there are few properties involved with it known as ACID properties that decide the overall behaviour of a transaction, it's initialisation and execution.


1. Atomicity:

It basically means in a transaction , there should never be incompleteness of any of the processes/queries which means either you perform all the queries or you do not perform any of the queries.

2. Consistency:

It means transation data should be consistent throughout i.e. before and after transaction, the data should be same.

3. Isolation:

It refers to the fact that any process or query from one transaction should not alter in any process of any other query.

4. Durability:

It means transaction should be durable and independent.
