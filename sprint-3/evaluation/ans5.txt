Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations. Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion, and update anomalies. So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations. Normal forms are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables.
1. First Normal Form –
If a relation contain composite or multi-valued attribute, it violates first normal form or a relation is in first normal form if it does not contain any composite or multi-valued attribute. A relation is in first normal form if every attribute in that relation is singled valued attribute.
Ex:-
ID   Name   Courses

1    A      c1, c2
2    E      c3
3    M      C2, c3



ID   Name   Course

1    A       c1
1    A       c2
2    E       c3
3    M       c2
3    M       c3

2. Second Normal Form –
To be in second normal form, a relation must be in first normal form and relation must not contain any partial dependency. A relation is in 2NF if it has No Partial Dependency, i.e., no non-prime attribute (attributes which are not part of any candidate key) is dependent on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table.


Example:
ID            	  COURSE                 FEE
1                     C1                  1000
2                     C2                  1500
1                     C4                  2000
4                     C3                  1000
4                     C1                  1000
2                     C5                  2000



ID               COURSE              COURSE                      FEE     
1                 C1                   C1                        1000
2                 C2                   C2                        1500
1                 C4             +     C3                        1000
4                 C3                   C4                        2000
4                 C1                   C5                        2000  

3. Third Normal Form –
A relation is in third normal form, if there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes as well as it is in second normal form.
A relation is in 3NF if at least one of the following condition holds in every non-trivial function dependency X –> Y

X is a super key.
Y is a prime attribute (each element of Y is part of some candidate key).
